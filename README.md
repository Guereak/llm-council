# LLM Council

## Project

This project was done as part of ESILV's GenAI class. The goal was to adapt Karpathy's "LLM Council" app to turn it into a distributed multi-LLM system in which multiple machines communicate via a network to form an LLM Council, resulting in a summarized final output generated by a dedicated Chairman LLM. Openrouter was ditched in favor of local Ollama models.

The idea of this repo is that instead of asking a question to your favorite LLM provider, you can group them into your "LLM Council". This repo is a simple, local web app that essentially looks like ChatGPT except it uses an Ollama network to send your query to multiple LLMs, it then asks them to review and rank each other's work, and finally a Chairman LLM produces the final response.

In a bit more detail, here is what happens when you submit a query:

1. **Stage 1: First opinions**. The user query is given to all LLMs individually, and the responses are collected. The individual responses are shown in a "tab view", so that the user can inspect them all one by one.
2. **Stage 2: Review**. Each individual LLM is given the responses of the other LLMs. Under the hood, the LLM identities are anonymized so that the LLM can't play favorites when judging their outputs. The LLM is asked to rank them in accuracy and insight.
3. **Stage 3: Final response**. The designated Chairman of the LLM Council takes all of the model's responses and compiles them into a single final answer that is presented to the user.


## Generative AI Usage Statement

Whilst the system design and most of the backend was developped without Generative AI tools, lack of React expertise and a strong will to not spend days centering divs led us to use Cursor's Composer 1 Agent for most of the frontend work.

For the backend work, method descriptions were AI generated as well as some error handling for sensitive functions. All code we wrote manually was evaluated by either Cursor agents or GitHub's copilot agent (automatic when reviewing PRs) to ensure strong code quality and ease of development.




## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

The project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for project management.

**Backend:**
```bash
uv sync
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

### 2. Configure Nodes

```
TODO
```


### 3. Configure Models (Optional)

Edit `backend/config.py` to customize the council:

```python
TODO
```

## Running the Application

**Option 1: Use the start script**
```bash
./start.sh
```

**Option 2: Run manually**

Terminal 1 (Backend):
```bash
uv run python -m backend.main
```

Terminal 2 (Frontend):
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.10+), async httpx, Ollama
- **Frontend:** React + Vite, react-markdown for rendering
- **Storage:** JSON files in `data/conversations/`
- **Package Management:** uv for Python, npm for JavaScript
